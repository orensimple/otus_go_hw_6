cc compatible for given platform. So if the development is done on OSX/Windows you need to build gcc to be able to compile for Linux. At least for me, the configuration of gcc to cross compile the C code is not so straightforward on OSX. If the CGO is needed, the docker image is the best way how to create Linux build. The only requirement: Docker has to be installed.
